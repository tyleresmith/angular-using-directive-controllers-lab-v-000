# Using Directive Controllers

## Objectives

- Create and bind a new Controller to the Directive

## Instructions

In this repo, we've got a list of contacts displayed using a directive named `<contact-card>`.

If you load up `index.html`, you'll see the usernames being displayed are in a mixture of uppercase and lowercase  letters. This doesn't look great.

Attach a controller to our contact card directive, changing all usernames to be displayed in lowercase. ** Note ** You should **NOT** have to edit the `ContactController` file in any way.
